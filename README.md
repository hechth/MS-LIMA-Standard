MS-LIMA is a software for mass spectral library management.

## Acceptable formats
+ MSP formats (.msp; from RIKEN CSRS, MoNA)
+ MGF format (.mgf)
+ MassBank format (.txt)

## How to use
Please import your mass spectral library file from menu.


MS-LIMA automatically makes compound groups based on meta data (InChI, InChIKey, or ShortInChIKey), and investigate the library errors about retention time (large difference), InChIKey, and formaula in each compound group.


## MainWindow
![MainWindow](https://github.com/tipputa/MS-LIMA-Standard/blob/master/MS-LIMA/Pic/190529_MS-LIMA.PNG?raw=true)
It consists of Mass spectrum view and 3 tables, compound table, mass spectra table, and peak table.
If users change selected compound, spectra table and peak informations are automatically changed.
Users can directly change peak tables for curation.
